::: TODO :::
1. Remove red guys when they hit the red areas
2. Maximum ball count
3. Correct cleanup of the table and balls
    -> starting a new game is currently not possible!!

The game is fun, but it defenitely needs more gameplay elements, otherwise it's just hit bals away and don't let them fall down.
    -> even standard pinball has fancy bumpers with sounds and scoring.
    So we should implement as many of the following maybes and ideas as possible

::: MAYBE :::
New levels and more backstory (possibly on saturday and sunday)
Winning conditions 
    Possible winning conditions
        - 50-100 blue dudes in the club
        - Play for a limited time (1-5 Minutes per level) (could add a story and a timeless free/survival mode)
    -> Result screen

::: IDEAS ::::
Add rubber band like objects where the balls bounce away from
Yellow dudes which transform into ?a random color?
Police balls that do remove red balls on hit. They won't have any effect if the get into the club.
difficulty (addition in options which sets spawn rate and red/blue ratio)

::: To discuss :::
Should red dudes really remove blue dudes from the counter?
    -> Maybe better to let them all count but in a result window subtract the reds from the blues.
